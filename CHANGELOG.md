* The identity claim type set in the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer is now automatically detected and associated with the property UserPrincipalName
* Fixed no result returned under high load, caused by a thread safety issue where the same filter was used in all threads regardless of the actual input
* Improved validation of changes made to ClaimTypes collection
* Added method ClaimTypeConfigCollection.GetByClaimType()
* Implemented unit tests
* Explicitly encode HTML messages shown in admin pages and rendered from server side code to comply with tools scanning code to detect security vulnerabilities
* Fixed display text of groups that were not using the expected format "(GROUP) groupname"

## AzureCP v12 enhancements & bug-fixes - Published in June 7, 2018

* Improved: AzureCP now uses the unified [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) instead of the old [Azure AD Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api).
* New: AzureCP can be entirely configured with PowerShell, including claim types configuration
* Updated: AzureCP administration pages are now created as User Controls and are reusable by developers.
* Improved: AzureCP claims mapping page is easier to understand
* Updated: Logging is more relevant and generates less messages.
* New: Timeout of connection is 4 secs and can be customized
* Improved: When multiple tenants are set, they are queried in parallel
* Updated: Tenant ID is no longer needed to register a tenant
* Improved: Nested groups are now supported, if group permissions are created using the ID of groups (new default setting).
* **Beaking change**: By default, AzureCP now creates group permissions using the Id of the group instead of its name (group IDs are unique, not names). There are 2 ways to deal with this: Modify group claim type configuration to reuse the name, or migrate existing groups permissions to set their values with their group ID
* **Beaking change**: Due to the amount of changes in this area, the claim types configuration will be reset if you update from an earlier version.
* Many bug fixes and optimizations
