# Replay the Graph requests executed by EntraCP

This is the root folder of a [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) collection (an alternative API debugger to Postman), that contains the typical requests ran by EntraCP.

To use it:

* Clone this folder
* Rename/copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it with your tenant data
* Install [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) and open this collection in Bruno
* Load environment `entracp-environment`
* Open request authentication > get access token. Click tab `Auth` and `Get Access Token`

You can not replay the requests.
